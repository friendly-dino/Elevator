Hi, this is my implementation of the Elevator Code Exercise. I followed the instructions as closely as could.

Notes:	

	  The logger I made is a makeshift logger to imitate an actual logging(whether 3rd party or database logging),can be extended.
 
 	  The ProcessRequest method can be improved, but I aimed to make the elevator work as intended in the instruction.
  
    The FindBestElevator uses a custom logic I made but like ProcessRequest, this too can be modified to add more conditions.
   
   	The usage of Threading is not in my initial design, I found it through constantly modifying and refactoring my code.
    
    I made unit tests to check if the fundamental functions are working as expected.
